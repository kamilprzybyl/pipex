# Pipex
## What are pipes?
A pipe is an enclosed medium that allows flow from one end to another. In the real-world pipes are used to convey matter, mostly liquid such as water or gas such as smoke but sometimes convey a mixture of liquid and solids. In a Linux environment, a pipe is a special file that connects the output of one process to the input of another process.

## Usage
```
git clone <repo>
cd <repo>
make
./pipex [input redirection] [cmd_1], [cmd_2], [cmd_3], ... [output redirection]
```
